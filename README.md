## About AISOC

This is a practical course where you'll learn to build, deploy and maintain machine learning and ai systems. We focus on the engineering side from training models to getting them to work in production. Cutting across key skills: 
- [Applied AI](/aisoc-season-2/Applied_AI)
- [Machine Learing](/aisoc-season-2/Machine%20Learning/)
- [LLM Engineering](/aisoc-season-2/LLM%20Engineering/)
- [Production AI](/aisoc-season-2/Production%20AI/)

**You'll learn:**
- Core ML, LLM algorithms and when to use them
- Model evaluation and selection
- AI models, Agentic systems and RAG applications
- Management of AI applications


## Prerequisites

**You'll need:**

### MACHINE LEARNING
Working knowledge of a programming language such as Python, either in the context of analytics, data science or software development. Prior experience in numerical and exploratory data analysis using tools like Numpy, Pandas, SQL and Matplotlib is a plus. For the ML engineering focus, prior experience in scikit-learn or other machine learning frameworks is expected.


### APPLIED AI 
Working knowledge of a programming language such as Python, either in the context of analytics, data science or software development. Familiarity with APIs, cloud, and web frameworks is a plus, but not strictly required.


### LLM ENGINEERING
Working knowledge of Python or similar languages in the context of machine learning or software development. At least basic familiarity with prompt engineering and LLM APIs such as OpenAI API for prototyping. Familiarity with GPUs, CUDA, HuggingFace, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, or prior experience in traditional ML is a plus but not mandatory.
You don't need any prior experience with machine learning. We'll start from the basics.

### Production AI
Working knowledge of Python or similar languages in the context of software development or machine learning. At least basic familiarity with prompt engineering and LLM APIs for prototyping. Prior experience with shell scripting, Docker and cloud platforms is a plus. Familiarity with HuggingFace, GPUs and CUDA and is also welcome but not strictly required.
